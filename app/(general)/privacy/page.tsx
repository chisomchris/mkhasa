          What Personal Information About Customers Does Mkhasa.com Gather?
        </h2>
        <p className="pb-2">
          The information we collect and learn from customers helps us
          personalize and continually improve your Mkhasa experience. One of our
          goals in collecting personal information from you is to provide an
          efficient, meaningful, and customized experience. Here are the general
          categories of information we gather:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store
            information you enter on our website, or give us in any other way.
            Examples include, but are not limited to, information when you
            search, browse, buy, post reviews, participate in a sweepstakes or
            questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. We use the
            information that you provide for purposes such as responding to your
            requests, processing your order, customizing future shopping
            experiences, responding to you, or sending you marketing and
            advertising communications. If we encounter a problem when
            processing your order, your personal information may be used to
            contact you. Please note that before accessing certain parts of
            Mkhasa.com or completing an order, you must create an account with
            us, through which you must provide certain personal information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store certain
            types of information automatically whenever you interact with us.
            For example, like many websites, we use “cookies” or other unique
            identifiers and we obtain certain types of information when your web
            browser accesses Mkhasa.com or advertisements and other content
            served by, or on behalf of, Mkhasa.com on other websites. Other
            examples include, but are not limited to, log files, internet
            protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the internet,
            and internet browser type.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>E-mail Communications:</strong> To help us make emails more
            useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you
            open email from Mkhasa.com, if your computer supports such
            capabilities. If you do not want to receive email from us (unrelated
            to transactions and/or your account), please adjust your email
            subscription settings in your Mkhasa account or contact our customer
            service team.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong> We might receive
            information about you from other sources and add it to our account
            information. Examples include, but are not limited to, updated
            delivery and address information from our carriers and information
            from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            Web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and
            other unique identifiers (collectively, “cookies”) are small pieces
            of information that are stored by your internet browser on your
            mobile phone’s or computer’s hard drive. Like many websites, Mkhasa
            uses cookies to speed your navigation of Mkhasa.com, enable you to
            select products, place them in an online shopping cart, and to
            purchase those products, along with allowing us to maintain a record
            of your browsing activity on our websites. Cookies also allow our
            systems to recognize your device and to provide features such as
            recently viewed items, brand recommendations, and personalized
            Mkhasa advertisements on other websites. OUR COOKIES DO NOT AND
            CANNOT INFILTRATE YOUR HARD DRIVE TO GATHER YOUR CONFIDENTIAL
            INFORMATION. Our cookies are not “spyware.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Most internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. Because
            cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Mkhasa.com’s
            essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. You
            can, however, set your browser to refuse cookies from websites or to
            remove cookies from your hard drive, but if you do, you may not be
            able to access or use portions of Mkhasa.com. For instance, if you
            block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add
            items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any
            Mkhasa.com products or services that require you to sign in.

          Does Mkhasa.com Share the Information It Receives?
        </h2>
        <p className="pb-2">
          Information about our customers is an important part of our business,
          and we are not in the business of selling, renting or trading it to
          others. We share customer information only as described in this
          Privacy Notice and with entities within Mkhasa Technologies Limited.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We may employ other
            companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
            Examples include, but are not limited to, fulfilling orders,
            delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing
            repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data,
            providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links
            (including paid listings and links), processing credit card
            payments, providing customer service, storing data, and serving ads
            on our behalf. They have access to personal information needed to
            perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Promotional Offers:</strong> Sometimes we send offers to
            selected groups of Mkhasa.com customers in collaboration with other
            businesses. When we do this, we do not allow that business to access
            your information. You may have the opportunity to separately share
            information with those other businesses, and if you do, that
            information would be governed by such company’s privacy policy. You
            may adjust your email subscription settings in your Mkhasa.com
            account or by contacting our customer service team.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our
            business, we might sell or buy stores, companies, or business units.
            In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the
            transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
            in any pre-existing privacy notice (unless, of course, the customer
            consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Mkhasa, or
            substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information
            will of course be one of the transferred assets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protection of Mkhasa.com and Others:</strong> We release
            account and other personal information when we believe release is
            appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions
            of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or
            safety of Mkhasa.com, our customers, or others. This includes
            exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
            fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this
            does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing
            personally identifiable information from customers for commercial
            purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy
            Notice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, we
            may seek your consent for us to share your information with
            additional third parties, and you will have the opportunity in your
            discretion to choose not to share your information.
